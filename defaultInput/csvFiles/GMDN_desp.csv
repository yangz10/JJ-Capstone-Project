This is a single-use device."61872,"Endoscopic electrosurgical electrode, bipolar, single-use","A sterile, invasive, distal component of an electrosurgical system intended to deliver electrosurgical current in a bipolar configuration (i.e., without a return electrode) to tissues for cutting/coagulation/ablation during endoscopic (including laparoscopic, arthroscopic) surgery. It is a long thin device available in a variety of forms (e.g., exchangeable electrode for electrosurgical forceps, rigid electrode, flexible endoscopic probe) which may include a lumen for suction/irrigation; it does not include a handpiece with any form of electrical or mechanical controls (e.g., does not include controlling ring-handles). This is a single-use device."61875,"Endoscopic electrosurgical electrode, monopolar, single-use","A sterile, invasive, distal component of an electrosurgical system intended to deliver electrosurgical current in a monopolar configuration (i.e., used with a patient contact return electrode) to tissues for cutting/coagulation/ablation during endoscopic (including laparoscopic, arthroscopic) surgery. It is a long thin device available in a variety of forms (e.g., exchangeable electrode for electrosurgical forceps, rigid electrode, flexible endoscopic probe) which may include a lumen for suction/irrigation; it does not include a handpiece with any form of electrical or mechanical controls (e.g., does not include controlling ring-handles). This is a single-use device."61917,Osteotomy guide,"A non-sterile surgical instrument intended to be attached to a portion of bone (e.g., pelvis, femur, tibia, ulna) during an osteotomy procedure to outline the desired cut-line and mechanically support/guide the cutting device (e.g., oscillating cutting saw). This is a reusable device intended to be sterilized prior to use."61945,Corn dressing,"A non-sterile adhesive dressing intended for the treatment of corns or calluses (hardened areas of skin on the feet or toes) consisting of a pad of material (e.g., hydrocolloid) impregnated with an acid (e.g., salicylic) which acts as a keratolytic agent to facilitate the removal of dead skin. It may be supplied with another dressing (e.g., ring) which provides cushioning around the lesion. It is normally available [non-prescription] over-the-counter (OTC). This is a single-use device."61951,"Endoscopic electrosurgical electrode, bipolar, reprocessed","A sterile, invasive, distal component of an electrosurgical system intended to deliver electrosurgical current in a bipolar configuration (i.e., without a return electrode) to tissues for cutting/coagulation/ablation during endoscopic (including laparoscopic, arthroscopic) surgery.
